Agentic Workflow using CrewAI and Groq
=====================================

This script demonstrates a multi-agent workflow where specialized AI agents
collaborate to complete complex tasks. The workflow includes:

1. Research Agent - Gathers and analyzes information
2. Content Creator Agent - Creates content based on research
3. Reviewer Agent - Reviews and provides feedback
4. Technical Writer Agent - Creates technical documentation

The agents work together in a coordinated workflow to complete tasks efficiently.
